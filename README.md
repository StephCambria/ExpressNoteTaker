## Description
A simple application that allows users to input, update, and delete notes. The current notes, as well as the note history, is stored in a JSON file.

This project provided me with finished front-end code, and required me to build the back-end portion of the code from scratch. Using express.js, I was able to develop a file system to utilize basic routing. Each file is organized and called via server.js.



## Installation
This application is deployed via Heroku (pending).

However, if you want to run it locally, follow these steps:

* open the command line and clone the project locally
* import express by typing ```npm install express --save```
* type ```node server.js```
* alternatively, type ```npm start```

## Usage
This application (and repository) serve as a helpful point of reference for both the front and back-end of web development, as it utilizes aspects of both symbiotically.

On the front-end:
* users are able to write, edit, and delete notes directly
* user input is stored in a JSON file.

On the back-end:
* developers will be able to navigate a clean file structure to see how the code is working
* router setup is simplified, organized, and unique to each file
* comments are written as often as possible to give a simple description of the back-end functionality
